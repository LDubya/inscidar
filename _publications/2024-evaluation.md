- We conducted a first-of-its-kind evaluation of digital accessibility in life sciences data resources.

- Our comprehensive analysis reveals that many life sciences resources have “severe” accessibility issues (74.8% of data portals and 69.1% of journal websites) and are significantly less accessible than US government websites.

- Focusing on visual impairment, we evaluated three data portals in-depth with a blind user, unveiling the practical impact of the identified accessibility issues on common tasks (53.3% success rate), such as data discovery tasks.
