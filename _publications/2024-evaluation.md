- As the first of its kind, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of life sciences data resources, reaviling significant accessibility barriers.

- Our analysis shows that many life sciences resources have “severe” accessibility issues (74.8% data portals and 69.1% journal websites) and are significantly less accessible than US goverment websites.

- Focusing on visual impairment, we evaluated three data portals in-depth with a blind user, unveiling the practical impact of the identified accessibility issues on common tasks (53.3% success rate), such as data discovery tasks.
